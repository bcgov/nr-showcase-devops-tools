# Natural Resources Common Services Showcase DevOps Tools Repository

This repository is for the NR Common Services Showcase Devops tools.  This includes our Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CICD) setup used in other projects.  The tools are used to create a full Pull Request based CICD pipeline.  This is continually evolving as more tools are added (ex. Sonarqube) to our pipeline.
